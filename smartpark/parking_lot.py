### Class: ParkingLot
class ParkingLot:
    '''Import the library in your code using `import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt`.
    - Create an MQTT client instance: `client = mqtt.Client()`.
    - Connect the client to the MQTT broker using the provided host and port: `client.connect(broker_host, broker_port)`.
    - Subscribe to a topic to receive messages: `client.subscribe("topic_name")`.
    - Define a callback function to handle received messages: `def on_message(client, userdata, message): ....`
    - Assign the callback function to the client: `client.on_message = on_message`.
    - Start the client loop to process network traffic: `client.loop_start()`.'''
